# Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Final Project
Project Members - Shashang Murali, Shaotian Wu

# Project Description

- Implementing HMM forward - backward algorithm and testing it for a given discrete input distribution.
- The main focus of the project was to understand the working of the forward-backward algorithm and how it reduces the computational complexities
  of calculating state probabilities and output probabilities.
- The code for the algorithm is written in MarkovChain class of PattRecClasses folder.
